<h1>The Best Movies/Web-Series According to me</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies/Web-Series of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Game of thrones</h3>
<p>Mind Boggling show that shows us the true nature of a human being. Nobody is a perfect being and nobody is completely
    inhumane either.</p>
<h3>2. You</h3>
<p>Obsession can make people do funny things and when its love it can make one kill.</p>
<h3>3. Shutter Island</h3>
<p>A cracker that hooks you onto the edge of your emotions till the very end and ofcourse the climax is left upon the
    viewers to ponder about.</p>
